h1. Demo for How to Transition Between Multiple Charts

h2. Running

h3. View the code in the browser

You can start up a local webserver by using python's simple server:

<pre>
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
</pre>

or @thin@ in ruby

<pre>
thin start -p 8000
# might have to run 'bundle install' first
</pre>

Now go to "http://0.0.0.0:8000":http://0.0.0.0:8000/

and you should see the Demo running on your machine.

h3. Start Coding

Open up @coffee/vis.coffee@ and start modifying the visualization to fit your needs.

h2. Folder Organization

* @/index.html@
** main page for your visualization. Loads coffeescript and javascript files.
* @/coffee/@
** @vis.coffee@ - source code for visualization
* @/data/@
** storage location for @requests.json@ - the data loaded in visualization
* @/js/@
** javascript goes here. JS Libraries in @libs@ directory
* @/css/@
** stylesheets are in here
* @/tools/@
** scripts that were used to parse raw 311 data and get it into the right shape for the visualization.

h3. Data Source and formatting 

I was able to download the entire 311 Service Request data from here:
https://nycopendata.socrata.com/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9

The total file size was around 2.5Gb at the time of download. 

First, @limit_311.rb@ was used to filter the dataset down to a reasonable size around the time I was interested in.

Then, @parse_311.rb@ was used on this smaller file to extract out and format the data. 

Not very efficient (I think R or Python with pandas would be a lot faster) but it got the job done for me.
